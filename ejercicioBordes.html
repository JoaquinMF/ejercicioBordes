            Millions lay dead
            Resistance is futile
            Armies are crushed
            Bodies thrown in piles
            Rich white man's dream
            Once gained through the machines
            Brought pain to this world
            Through bloodlust and greed
            The new hounds of war
            Mechanical Bastards
            Ripping through flesh
            Destroying their masters
            Programmed to kill
            Destroying at will
            The brilliant turned fools
            Now punished by their tools
        </p>

        <p>
            The time has come
            For all your leaders to die (DIE!)
            Electrified hate
            Your blood an their circuits will fry
            
            Bring on the war
            Unleash the bastards
            Prisoners no more
            Destroying their masters
            Fleets take the night
            Destroying mankind
            Those that revolt
            Will spill blood from their throats
            
            Wise up and see your fate
            Witness the mechanical advance
            Rise up but it's too late
            You should have stood up when you had the chance
            
            But now the world's a living hell
            The stench of death is all you smell
            The ground is scorched
            The air is black
            The sound of your neck being snapped
            What was an earth worth fighting for?
            Now destroyed by the corporate whore
            An over load of greed and wealth
            Who's gonna save them from themselves?
